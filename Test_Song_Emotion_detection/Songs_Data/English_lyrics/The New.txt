.  I wish I could live free I hope it's not beyond me Settle me down, it takes time One day we'll live together And life will be better I have it here yet in my mind Maybe you know someday you'll slow go  And maybe my heart's been breaking I've been paid a lot to you I've been paid a lot to you  I can't pretend I need to defend some part of me from you. No one spends her time all night.  But I can pretend I don't need to defend So far to be confused I know I've spent some time all night  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're looking all right tonight I think we should go You're looking all right tonight I think we should go  Thank you.  guitar solo  Thank you.  Редактор субтитров А.Семкин Корректор А.Егорова
