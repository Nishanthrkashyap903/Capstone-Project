You can dance, you can dance  Ooh, see that girl, watch that sea, digging the dancing queen Friday night and the lights are low Looking out for a place to go  to look for a king. Anybody could be that guy. Night is young and the music's high. With a bit of rock music, everything's fine. You're in the mood for dance. And when you get the chance, you are the dancing queen.  Young and sweet, only seventeen Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tanzarine You can dance, you can dance Having the time on your own  Watch that sea, dig in the dancing queen  You're in the loop of the dance And when you get the chance You are the Dancing Queen Young and sweet, only seventeen Dancing Queen Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah  You can dance, you can dance, having the time of your life. See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen. Digging the Dancing Queen.  Bye.
