so  I'm going under in this time I fear there's no one to save me This all or nothing really go to where you're driving me crazy I need somebody to hear, somebody to know, somebody to have, somebody to hold me  It's easy to say, but it's never the same I guess I kinda like the way you numbed all the pain Now the day bleeds into nightfall And you're not here to get me through it all I left my gun down and then you pulled the rug I was scared I kinda used to being someone you loved  In this time I fear there's no one to turn to This old or nothing way of loving God be sleeping without you I need somebody to know Somebody to hear Somebody to have Just to know how it feels It's easy to say But it's never the same  Help me escape Now the day bleeds into nightfall And you're not here to get me through it all I left my gun down And then you pulled the rug I was scared and kinda used to be And so what you loved And I tried to close my eyes when it hurts Sometimes I fall into your eyes  So be safe in your soul till I go back around For now the day bleeds, and tonight it falls And you know it heats, it get me through it all I let my guard down, and then you pull the rug I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved But now the day bleeds, and tonight it falls  To get me through it all I left my guard down And then you pulled the rug I was getting kinda used to be it's the one you loved I left my guard down And then you pulled the rug I was getting kinda used to be it's the one you loved  you
