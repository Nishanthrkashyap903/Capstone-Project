Georgia, Georgia The whole day through  Just an old sweet song Keeps Georgia on my mind I said Georgia Georgia A song of you  Comes as sweet and clear Is moonlight through the pines Other arms reach out to me Other eyes smile tenderly  Still in the peaceful dreams I see The road leads back to you I say Georgia Oh Georgia No peace I find  Just an old sweet song Keeps Georgia on my mind But the arms reach out to me But the eyes smile tenderly  Still in peaceful dreams I see the road leads back to you. Oh, Georgia, Georgia. No peace, no peace I find.  Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind. I say just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind.  you
