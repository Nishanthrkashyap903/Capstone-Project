Down in the valley, the first of May Gathering flowers, both fresh and gay  Gathering flowers, both red and blue A little thought of what love can do Don't you Break my heart  Don't you break my heart I put my hand into the bush  I'm in the sweetest, sweetest rose in the world I prick my finger deep to the light And left the sweetest rose, sweetest rose behind Don't you?  Break my heart Don't you Break my heart  Субтитры подогнал «Симон»  Saw a ship sailing on a deep blue sea She sailed as deep as, deep as she could be But not so deep as, in love as I am I cannot breath her eyes, I'll sing the spirit  Don't you break my heart? Don't you break my heart?  Don't you break my heart Don't you break my heart  Thousands and thousands all along this earth
