I found a love for all of me  Follow my lead I found a girl Beautiful and sweet I never knew you were the someone waiting for me Cause we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowing what it was  You up this time Darling, just kiss me slow Your heart is all I own And in your eyes, you're holding mine Baby, I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms  Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favorite song When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath But you heard it Darling, you look perfect tonight  Stronger than anyone I know She shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share her home I found a love To carry more than just my secrets To carry love, to carry children of our own  So in love, fighting against all odds I know we'll be alright this time Darling, just hold my hand Be my girl, I'll be your man I see my future in your eyes  I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favorite song When I saw you in that dress Looking so beautiful I don't deserve this Darling, you were perfect  We are now at the University of Texas  To our favorite song I have faith in what I see Now I know I have met an angel In person And she looks perfect I don't deserve this You look perfect tonight  you
