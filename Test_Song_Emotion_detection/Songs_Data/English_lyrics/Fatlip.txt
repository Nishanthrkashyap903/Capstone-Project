Nevertheless, I'm dressed for the occasion It's number 32 and I hear other situations If the pee moves your feet then don't change the station Thank you, babe, cause you're leaving on a permanent vacation Well, I'm a disaster A microphone master Put on the tape, a rocket ghetto blaster It's not about the money cause it tells the resort's about sweating all the f***ers in the bankers shorts  I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school Never going, never showing up what we had to Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave I'm sick of always hearing that you rage I don't want to raise my heart  I'm becoming another casualty of society I'll never fall in line Becoming another victim of living for money I've backed out Because you don't know us at all We last when old people fall But what would you expect when our conscience is so small Heavy metal and mullet is how we were  We like having fun at other people's expense and cutting people down is just a minor offense and set up your concern I guess I'll never learn I'm sick of being told to win my turn I don't wanna waste my time Become another casualty of society I'll never fall in line Become another victim of your good form I need to back down  Don't count on me to let you know when Don't count on me, I'll do it again Don't count on me, the point you're missing Don't count on me, cause I'm not missing  I don't wanna waste my time Become another casualty of society I'll never fall in line Become another victim of your conform and your back down  Society, face by side. Fix up on the form of money and back down.
