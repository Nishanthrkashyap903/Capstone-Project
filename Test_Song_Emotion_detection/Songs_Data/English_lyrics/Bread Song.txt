Okay, well I just woke up And you already don't care That I tried my best to hold you Through the headset that you wear And as tight as I might hold it Over where the signal's good  There's no way to save your evening now Through the little fun I could And yes, I was tempted And I christened me lonely I pretended to falter And I burned scented candles there  I hung some good pictures red The paintwork was perfect So no one could doubt it That I was still losing  So show me the land you acquired And slip into something beside The holes you tried  And lay out your rules for the night I don't eat your toast in my bed  Oh, darling I I never felt the crumbs in till you said this place is not for any man nor particles  You furnished your suffering  We all gathered singing Good words that you'd stolen And every phone died then And no one had wifi Inside your apartment We knelt at your altar  Okay, well I just woke up And you already don't care That I tried my best to hold you Through the headset that you wear And as tight as I might hold it Over where the signal's good  There's no way to save your evening now And I'm ready for the show that's interesting So show me the land you acquired And slip into something beside  The holes you try to hide And lay out your rules for tonight Don't beat your toast in my bed Oh, darling I  I never felt the closing till you said this place is not for any man. Nor particles of bread.  you
