Come on Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you! Holding me back Gravity's holding me back I want you to hold out the palm of your hand Why don't we leave it there? Nothing to say When everything gets in the way  Seems you cannot be replaced And I'm the one who will stay In this world It's just us You know it's not the same as it was In this world It's just us You know it's not the same as it was  As it was, as it was We know it's not the same Answer the phone, Harry you're no good alone Why are you sitting at home on the floor? What kind of pills do you want? Ringing the bell, and nobody's coming to help Your daddy lives by myself  It's just us. You know, it's not the same as it was.  We know it's not the same  As it was As it was
