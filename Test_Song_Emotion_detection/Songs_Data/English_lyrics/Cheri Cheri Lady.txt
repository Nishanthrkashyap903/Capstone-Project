Oh, I cannot explain  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'll get up, I'll get down, all my world turns around. Who was right, who was wrong, I don't know. I've got pain in my heart, got a love in my soul. Easy come, but I think, easy go. I need me slow, all the times I move so slow.  Sherry, Sherry Lady, going through emotion. Love is where you find it, listen to your heart. Sherry, Sherry Lady, living in devotion. It's always like the first time, let me take a part. Sherry, Sherry Lady, let me start tomorrow. Take my heart to lose and listen to your heart. Sherry, Sherry Lady, to know you're just for nothing.  If you're going to change, I'll be a wager.  Thank you.
