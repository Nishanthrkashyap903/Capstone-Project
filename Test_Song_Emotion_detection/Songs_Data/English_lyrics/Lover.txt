We could leave the Christmas lights up till January  This is our place, we made the rules And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear Have I known you twenty seconds, twenty years? Can I go where you go?  This close forever and ever And I'll take me out and take me home You're my, my, my, my lover We could let our friends crash in the living room  This is our place, we make the call. And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you. I've left you three summers now, honey, but I want them all. Can I go where you go?  Can we always be this close forever and ever? And I take me out and take me home forever and ever. You're my, my, my, my lover. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand? With every guitar string scar on my hand, I take this magnetic  And the force of a man to be my lover My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue I'll swell that ends well to end up with you Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover And you'll say all your dirtiest jokes for me And at every table  Sleeps, never. Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever? And I'll take me out and take me home forever and ever. You're my, my, my, my.  Oh, you're my, my, my, my Oh, you're my, my, my, my Don't think you're my, my, my, my Lover
