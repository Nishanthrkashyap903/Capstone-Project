Oh, there's a river that winds on forever I'm gonna see where it leads Oh, there's a mountain on a land that's mounted  Thank you.  To the ends of the answers you found me If you won't, I'm a saint like it passed to me  Oh, there's an island where all things are silent I'm gone with so tender Oh, there's a visit that size can't be made  I'm going to count on doom. Out there's a world that calls for the girl, heading out to the unknown. With faring strangers and all kinds of danger, please don't say I'm going alone. To the ends of the earth, would you follow me? There's a world that was meant for our eyes.  I was ready to die for you, baby.  Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay What good is living the life you've been given If I only do is stand in my place I'm on a river that winds on forever Fought to luck and where I'm gone Maybe I'm heading to die But I still want to try I guess I'm going on  Thank you.  Thank you.
