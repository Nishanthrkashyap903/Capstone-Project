I can't ask your signs. I can't see the camera under 10 degrees.  Concord, this organ, a new one, I'm forming, it's grown so persistent on here by the morning I fell to my feet.  And the doctor said we are unfortunately running out of options to treat. What a funny way to speak.  I was breathless upon every mountain just to look for your life.  Concord, I miss you. Don't text me till winter. I can hardly afford a second summer of splinters. This staircase, it leads only to some old pictures of you. Through a thousand mile long shoot.  Hey, what's the city more to do? And you, blind Concord I came a gentle hill racer I was breathless upon every mountain Just to look for your life  Which share the same sky And then eyes of world suffer Come for your life  Thank you.  Concord, we're old now You wield a lightsaber And led by the dark To our place on the table So don't tell me you're hungry Cause darling, I'm starving myself And I heard you're on Atkins as well  I was made to love you. Can't you tell? And you, like Concord, I came in a light blue sleeper and I laid dead or twitchy for most of the night.  A sad man inside And I'll come to you like a child On the court I die free this time  Thank you.  you
