White man came across the sea He brought us pain and misery He killed our tribes, he killed our creeds He took our game for his own need  We fought him hard, we fought him well Out on the plains, we gave him hell But when it came, so much for free Oh, will we ever be set free? Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes Galloping hard on the plains Chasing the redskins back to their holes  Run for your lives  Soldier blue in the barren wastes Hunting and killing the game Raping the women and wasting the men The only good Indians are tame Selling them whiskey and taking their gold Enslaving the young and destroying the old Run to the hills Run for your lives  Run to the hills Run for your life  Yeah Riding to the hills  Run for your lives Run to the hills Run for your lives Run to the hills Run for your lives Run to the hills  Run for your eyes
