Stars shining bright above you, night breezes seem to whisper, I love you.  I'm a sycamore tree. Dream a little dream of me. Sit nighty night and kiss me. Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me. While I'm alone and blue as can be.  Dream of me Stars fading But I linger on dear Oh how you linger on Still craving your kiss How you crave my kiss Now I'm longing To linger till dawn dear Just sing this  Take your sweet dreams till sunbeams find you. Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you. But in your dreams, whatever they be, dream a little dream of me.  I linger on dear Still craving your kiss Yeah, I'm longing to linger till dawn dear Just saying this Sweet dreams Dreaming Till sunbeams find you Keep dreaming  Leave the worries behind you But in your dreams, whatever they be You've gotta make me a promise Promise to me You'll dream Dream a little dream of me  you
